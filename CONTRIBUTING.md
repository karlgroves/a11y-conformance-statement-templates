#CONTRIBUTING

This is not an exhaustive document and not intended to be the full, final list of requirements. These are general guidelines only. If something is unclear, ask for clarification.



## Workflow
Nothing fancy needed here, just a typical Branch Flow:

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone it
3. Each change should be tied to an [issue in Github](https://github.com/karlgroves/a11y-conformance-statement-templates/issues).
4. Create your issue.
5. Create a branch for your issue.
6. Commit your work to your branch
7. Issue your PR against the issue you created
